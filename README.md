# MineableSpawners
## Summary
A server side fabric mod that allows the player to have some control over mob spawners in survival.
## Features
- Mob Spawners are harvestable with a Silk Touch Pickaxe
- Player placed spawners are empty, and I have left it up to the mod user to decide how they want to fill them (remember that spawn eggs fill spawners).
- May I recommend [SpawnEggDrops](https://github.com/crdtrd/SpawnEggDrops)?
